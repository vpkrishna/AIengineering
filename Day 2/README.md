# Build 🏗️

Run the notebook! 

We'll be doing the following in today's notebook: 

1. Task 1: Simple Assistant
2. Task 2: Adding Tools
  - Task 2a: Creating an Assistant with File Search Tool
  - Task 2b: Creating an Assistant with Code Interpreter Tool
  - Task 2c: Creating an Assistant with Function Calling Tool

For a more "interactive" experience - you can reference the [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10yLbdblldyP49YEJNxh-ndl3n9Bf4pLu?usp=sharing) - but the preference would be for you to use the local environment as always.
